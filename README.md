Space Shooter is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship by moving it perpendicularly across the left side of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat 3 levels of eight aliens that move perpendicularly back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the left side of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the bullet cannon. With each level, the aliens' movement speed up.

The aliens attempt to destroy the ship moving closer to the left side of the screen.

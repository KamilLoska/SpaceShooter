Space Shooter is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship by moving it perpendicularly across the left side of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat 3 levels of eight aliens that move perpendicularly back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the left side of the screen.
